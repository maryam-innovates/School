# GGHS Tahir Model Website 🌐📚

This is the official website I built for **GGHS Tahir Model**, created with love and purpose — not just as a project, but as a way to give back to the amazing school community that shaped me.

## 🎯 Purpose

As a student and tech enthusiast, I built this website to:

- 🤝 Support students like me who want to feel more connected to their school
- 💻 Use my skills in web development to contribute something meaningful

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (Fully responsive design)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (for smooth animations and dynamic features)
- **Netlify** (for free deployment)

## ✨ Features

## ❤️ Giving Back

This is more than a website — it’s a thank-you to my school, teachers, and fellow students. I hope it inspires other students to use their skills for good, to learn, and to give back to their communities too.
